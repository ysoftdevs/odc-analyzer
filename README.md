This tool manages reports from OWASP Dependency Check. Features include:

* prioritizing vulnerabilities and vulnerable libraries by severity and number of affected projects
* providing list of projects affected by a particular vulnerability
* providing list of projects containing a particular library
* grouping projects by team
* upgrade advisor: checking if a newer version of a library has some known vulnerability
* library tagging

## Requirements

* Java 8
* PostgreSQL
* Updated ODC vulnerability database in PostgreSQL
* Bamboo server (read-only access to reports)

Bamboo server runs OWASP Dependency Check scans and provides reports. These reports are needed to be configured separately (this tool does not configure it).

## Config

The application is a standard Play framework application and [its deployment documentation](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/Production) applied there. Database, Bamboo server, list of project, authentication and so on can be configured in Play configuration file. There are two example files provided:

* ./production.conf-example
* ./conf/application.conf.-example â€“ for development

## Database

### App database

I decided to use PostgreSQL, because:

* It is easy to set up
* It is reasonably strict by default. For example, when you try to insert a 256-character string in varchar(64), you get an error. (In MySQL, it gets silently truncated by default!)
* It can handle subqueries well. (At time of the choice, the most up-to-date Slick version was 3.0.*, which used to generate much subqueries.)

### Vulnerability Database

The application also needs read-only access to vulnerability database maintained by OWASP Dependency Check. ODC currently supports multiple databases, including H2, MySQL and PostgreSQL. However, there are multiple issues with H2 for this usage. The first one issue is concurrent access. The concurrent access probably could have been somehow configured, but ODC uses various case for table names and column names. This makes it hard to support multiple databases at the same time.

## Running multiple instances behind load-balancer

Although Play framework is designed to allow running one application in multiple instances in order to balance the load, applications might break the share-nothing approach, which is also the case of this application. Such applications might not work properly when running in multiple instances behind a load balancer. We simply did not consider to be so important for this application, but if it is your concern, we are happy to accept pull requests that address this issue. There are basically two points with shared state:

* Cache. The cache can be purged manually, which might cause inconsistent behavior. For example, when you purge the cache on one server instance and you are switched to another instance then. This might be avoidable by adding some timestamp to some cookie, but this is not implemented.
* Cron task locking. The lock is held in an instance, not in database. This behavior is good when recovering from a crash, but you should not run the cron job on multiple servers at the same time. Not following this advice might lead to multiple exports (e.g., emails or issue tracker items) for one event and even to some crashes when a worker tries to add a ticket ID for already exported issue. Maybe no pull code change is desired and it should be administrator's responsibility to run the cron task on one machine only.
